 * This project could be our message board, the other is our actual work
 *
 * ToDo:
 * User Stories - one person is the "customer"
 * Setup GUI - JFrame, possible JButtons, etc..
 * Create Strategy for algorithms
 * Turn the "buttons" into observers
 * If needed, make the strategies into template methods also
 * Later on, use decorator for "pieces" if we have the time.
 * Actually meet.
